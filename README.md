# Spotify Music Player
This web application utilizes the Spotify API to select and play almost any song while incorporating a dynamic visual feature.

## Features
- Spotify account authentication [^1]
- Song searching
- Song selection/playing
- Dynamic visual that changes to the song

## Purpose

This application was built to learn authentication (using Lucia's documentation), Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind, Prisma, and Supabase.

[^1]: Only authorized users can access the Spotify music portion of the application. However, there is a "guest" page where users can experience the application with limited songs.
